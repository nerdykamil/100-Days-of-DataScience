# 100-Days-of-DataScience

This repository will contain the code and other files I go through while my journey of 100 days of data science the idea
is inspired by ______. The learning would be majorly based on lessons from DataScience cookbook by Tony, Benjamin,Sean
and Abhijit.
I usually work on computer vision projects and thought of learning data science on my own. Hope its helpful.
